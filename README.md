# CSC110 Final Project

Predicting future wildfire counts with a poisson regression model and a negative binomial regression model. 

## Our Goal

The overall objective for this project was to predict the wildfire count for any state in the U.S. in any given year using a poisson regression model and a negative binomial regression model. 

The reason we created two models was because a Poisson distribution assumes that the mean and the variance within the distribution are the same while a negative binomial distribution adjusts the variance independently from the mean.
